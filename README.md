# Some language (written in Rust obv.)

This is the beginning of a heavily rust-inspired language. I'm not sure I'll finish this, really just wanted to see if I could make a language, and try out a different parser crate (I use `pest` here).

The code quality isn't good (mainly error handling is missing), that's because I wanted to first of all figure out how to use `pest`, I might add errors later if the language gets somewhat close to done, or if I feel like it.

## TODOs

 - [x] boolean operators
 - [x] comparisons
 - [ ] chained comparators
 - [x] assignment without let
 - [ ] control structures (if, while, for, match)
 - [ ] functions
 - [ ] nested modules
 - [ ] static/const elements
 - [ ] traits
 - [ ] impl blocks
